Project 0: 2-Player Connect Four

The classic game "Connect four". Two players take turns to 'push down' pieces down a board. The first player that forms his/her pieces with a consecutive length of four (horizontal, vertical or diagonal)
is considered the winner. The game draws if the board is filled up with no players winning.

Players can choose the dimensions of the board, the number of games they want to play, and their player handles.
If players choose to play multiple games (>1), a scoring system keeps track to determine final winner. (win per round = 2 marks to winner, draw = +1 for both players)

Either player can choose to force end the game, no score is given for both players if so.
In each turn, player choose the column of the board they want to put their pieces in and the board is updated and printed to the console.

In multiple-round games, players get to switch the order of who goes first.
